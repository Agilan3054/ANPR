# Number Plate Recognition with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize number plates in images. The script utilizes the TensorFlow library for building and training the CNN model, and Tesseract OCR for extracting text from the recognized number plates.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Tesseract OCR
